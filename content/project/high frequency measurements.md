In order to further investigate the water movement and nutrient transport from agricultural fields, we developed equipment and algorithm to zoom in the hydrograph and chemograph both spatially and temporally. 
We installed self-designed high frequency sampling equipment to measure water quality from subsurface tile drainage outlet and from shallow groundwater.  

In the drain outlet, we depolyed V-notch weir and pressure transducers to measure drainage flow, and optical spetrophometer to continuously monitor nitrate concentration. The layout is shwon in Fig. 1.

In shallow groundwater, we installed 10 precise water quality wells in different locations in shallow groundwater.  The multi-point sampler is used to collect __fresh__ water samples from wells every 6 minutes. In other words, we took measurements in each well every hour.  The picture of measuring device is shown in Fig. 2

Further analysis of high frequency measurements were still undergoing as of April 2018.
